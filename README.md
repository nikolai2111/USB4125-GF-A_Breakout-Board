## 1. Description
This is a very simple and low level breakout board for the USB4125-GF-A a USB Type-C PD connector. Actually it's a breakout board for the footprint, with only the footprint on it, nothing else. The project was implemented with KiCAD, as single board or as a panel. It contains ready-to-use Gerber files for both, the single board and the panel (4x5 pcs.).
